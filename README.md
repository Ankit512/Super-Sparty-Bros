# SuperSpartyBros.
A 2D platformer game that mimics Mario built in Unity3D. Players can experience the nostalgia of the 16-bit gaming popular during the late 90's.

It consists of two levels.
Sparty must get the rose to clear the level, but there lies plenty of obstacles to get in the way. Collect coins. Jump on enemies to stun them. Pick up the rose for victory. Hold right-click to jump (and stun enemies). You can double jump by pressing Jump (spacebar) again when in midair.

Will Sparty be successful in this adventurous run?
